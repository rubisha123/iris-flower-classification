# Iris Flower Classification Project

This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica using the classic Iris dataset.

## Features
- Load and preprocess the Iris dataset
- Train multiple models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest)
- Evaluate models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Visualize performance and data distribution

## Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
